  In my free time I enjoy writing on <a href="https://chadbaldwin.net">my blog</a> about SQL and
  PowerShell, working on technical home projects such as smart home automation, networking,
  3D printing and 3D design. I also like to contribute to StackOverflow, Reddit
  communities for SQL/PowerShell and the SQL community Slack channel by helping answer peoples
  questions.
