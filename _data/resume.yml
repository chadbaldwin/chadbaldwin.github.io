  intro: >
    As a motivated and versatile software developer, I love taking on any project I can,
    large or small, I don't shy away from a challenge. Experienced in building and working
    with complex SQL Server ecosystems. I regularly keep up to date with all of the latest updates,
    changes, tools and best practices. I work well in both team and independent environments.
