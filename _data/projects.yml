    I've always enjoyed teaching, and I love learning new technologies and sharing tips and tricks
    I've picked up over the years. So back in Dec 2020 I decided to build my own blog.

    "Schema Search" as I've been calling it, is a stored procedure that focuses on searching the
    contents of system objects in order to help my understanding of the SQL Server system tables.
    Eventually, it turned into a tool that I use, at minimum, on a daily basis. The project is
    hosted on GitHub and is licensed for anyone to use or contribute!
